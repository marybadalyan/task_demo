Hey you, big star
Tell me when it's over (cloud)

Hey you, big mood
Guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through when the two
Hits the six and it's summer

(Cloud) come shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) shove it aside

I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowds in the street
And no sun
In my own summer


The shade is a tool
A device, a savior
See, I try and look up to the sky
But my eyes burn

(Cloud) come shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) shove it aside

(Cloud) come shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) shove it aside

I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowds in the street
And no sun
In my own summer

Come shove it, shove it, shove it
(Shove) shove it, shove it, shove it
(The sun) shove it, shove it, shove it
(Aside) shove it aside
